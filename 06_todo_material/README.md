# Bing Images

React app that previews Bing image of the day

## Preview
You can see the preview of the application at: http://sureshsarda.in/apps/todo/index.html

## Run
- Clone the app (this is not a single app but a part of a parent project)
```
git clone https://github.com/sureshsarda/react.git
```
- Navigate, install and run!
```
cd react/06_todo_material
npm install
npm start
```
The app will start at `localhost:3000`

## Build
```
npm run build
```

## What Remains
- Add a button to clear all items (delete)
- Do we need buttons to delete individual items?

### Future Plans
- Login to save tasks
- Dates to tasks
- Organize tasks on basis of dates
- Productivity Calendar
- Convert to Electorn App
