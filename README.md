# React
A frontend journey. I'm creating small apps to learn react.

## Apps
1. [Hello React](https://github.com/sureshsarda/react/tree/master/01_hello_react)
First react application, components
2. [Counter](https://github.com/sureshsarda/react/tree/master/02_events)
Event handling, more components
3. [Bing Images](https://github.com/sureshsarda/react/tree/master/03_bing_images)
Even more components and events, but this time with some CSS as well
